* Update this changelog for better formatting 
* Crop original full-width symbols to actual width

## Versions 

### [1.18.0] 2024-11-10 Magic Duels ability symbols!

#### Added

* Finally traced, handdrew, and placed all 56 available Magic Duels ability symbols. This was a labor of love more than anything else as I cannot imagine who is using these, but it gets us to completion of all of the official ability symbols. All of these are available in the format `.ms-ability-duels-{name}`, but for the ones where there are no current Arena/MODO symbol I've aliased those without `duels` for convenience ([#85](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/85))

#### Changed

* Duels had a higher resolution source for Reach, which is the only one of these that has the same current ability symbol. That one has been replaced with this better version.

### [1.17.1] 2024-11-08 Colorless split costs

#### Added

* Split costs now support the colorless split mana symbols on [Ulalek, Fused Atrocity](https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/4/ulalek-fused-atrocity) ([#139](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/139))

### [1.17.0] 2024-11-06 2024 abilities

* Note this release has not updated the LESS source files. It's become too much to maintain both sadly and LESS will be deprecated/removed going forward.
* Note also that bower.json has been removed. Mana has not been published there for a while and will only be officially published to NPM.

#### Added

* Pawprint cost symbol ([#129](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/129))
* Land Drop (D) and Legendary Mana (L) cost symbols from Mystery Booster 2 ([#134](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/134))
* 4th Edition tap symbol ([#124](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/124))
* Updated lifelink ability symbol ([#126](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/126))
* Arena Power and Toughness symbols from the new player experience ([#119](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/119))
* Mana Screw flavor watermark ([#115](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/115))
* Rad counter on MTGO ([#132](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/132))
* Brick, Deathtouch, and Charge punchout counters ([#116](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/116)). Goad and Finality added as aliases for the identical ability icons.
* Party class watermarks for Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard ([#136](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/136))
* Exalted ability symbol from MH3 ([#128](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/128))
* MKM ability symbols for Cloak, Case Solved, Collect Evidence, Disguise, Suspect, and Surveil ([#121](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/121))
* Print Case Solved symbol ([#118](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/118))
* LCI ability symbols for Craft, Descend, and Discover ([#117](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/117))
* KTK ability symbols for Delve, Ferocious, Outlast, and Morph ([#120](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/120))
* OTJ ability symbols for Plot, Saddle, Spree, and Crime ([#125](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/125))
* Spree card frame indicator ([#125](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/125))
* BLB ability symbols for Gift, Offspring, Valiant, Forage, and Expend ([#130](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/130))
* DSK ability symbols for Survival, Impending, Manifest Dread, and Eerie ([#133](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/133))

#### Changed

* **Breaking change:** with Pawprint now being {P}, Phyrexian has been moved to {H} instead. This changes the class names for these mana costs as of this version, so all `.ms-p` will now show the Pawprint instead of the Phyrexian symbol. Please replace Phyrexian with `.ms-h`. Sorry about this!
* Revised tap symbol aliased to `tap-3ed` in addition to `tap-alt`, to account for the other alternate tap symbol.
* Lifelink symbol has been updated following Arena's update. The previous one has been changed to `lifelink-original`.

#### Fixed

* Documented Goad, Commander, and Ticket symbols that were previously added ([#135](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana/issues/135))
